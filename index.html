<p>
  mStable Improvement Proposals (MIPs) describe standards for the mStable
  platform, including core protocol specifications, client APIs, and contract
  standards.

<h2>Contributing</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Review <a href="MIPS/mip-1">MIP-1</a>.</li>
  <li>Fork the repository by clicking "Fork" in the top right.</li>
  <li>
    Add your MIP to your fork of the repository. There is a
    <a href="https://github.com/mstable/MIPs/blob/master/mip-X.md"
      >template MIP here</a
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Submit a Pull Request to mStable's
    <a href="https://github.com/mstable/MIPs">MIPs repository</a>.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Your first PR should be a first draft of the final MIP. It must meet the
  formatting criteria enforced by the build (largely, correct metadata in the
  header). An editor will manually review the first PR for a new MIP and assign
  it a number before merging it. Make sure you include a
  <code>discussions-to</code> header with the URL to a discussion forum or open
  GitHub issue where people can discuss the MIP as a whole.
</p>
<p>
  If your MIP requires images, the image files should be included in a
  subdirectory of the `assets` folder for that MIP as follow:
  <code>assets/mip-X</code> (for mip <b>X</b>). When linking to an image in the
  MIP, use relative links such as <code>../assets/mip-X/image.png</code>.
</p>
<p>
  When you believe your MIP is mature and ready to progress past the WIP phase,
  you should ask to have your issue added to the next governance call where it
  can be discussed for inclusion in a future platform upgrade. If the community
  agrees to include it, the MIP editors will update the state of your MIP to
  <code>Approved</code>.
</p>
